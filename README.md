> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

There are no requirements or dependencies but I highly recommend using a MCFunctions language extension for syntax highlighting like [this](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=arcensoth.language-mcfunction).

## Known Issues

Feel free to report any issues that you have.
